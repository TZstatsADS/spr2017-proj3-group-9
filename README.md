+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. 
We extacted our features by combined SIFT,PCA, LASSO,HOG and some basic image features to our feature dataset. To make a better model, we also tried SVM-kernel, KNN, GBM, Random Forest and CNN models to train our features. After all the attempt mentioned above we got our final classification engine.
