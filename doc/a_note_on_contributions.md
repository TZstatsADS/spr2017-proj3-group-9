### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Project 3(Group9)

Team members: Liangbin Chen, Yaqin Li, Tongyue Liu, Imroze Shaheen, Zheren Tang

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the classification accuracy for images of cats and dogs to 89%

[Contribution Statement] 
Liangbin Chen developed baseline classification model for evaluation. And has constructed and improved the Random forest model.
Tongyue Liu, Yaqin Li, Zheren Tang tried KNN, SVM, Xgboost, Random Forest classification model for the model part. And have selected features together through various methods including OpenCV, PCA, logistic, Transform Distance, SIFT and HOG. Imroze woked on the CNN model with CNN features with Python classification. 
All team discussed together and make the model evaluations together. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
